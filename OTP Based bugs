1) Bruteforce the otps

2) send the otp send link for the otp rate limit bypass technique (also check on reset otp)

3) analyse and change the response

4) send the 0000 -default otp to accept the req  -> check this for detail (https://cybersecuritywriteups.com/how-i-made-2000-from-an-easy-bug-431f45d8783e)

5)check for the rareparameters and headers which will makes for the rate limit protections.

6) Using null byte and CRLF (a tip from Zseano)

%00, %0d%0a, %09, %0C, %20, %0

X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1

X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1

X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1

X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1

or

Try with X-Forwarded-For: IP Header 2x times Instead of One time. (Tip from Kiraak Boy)
