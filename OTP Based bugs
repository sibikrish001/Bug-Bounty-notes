1) Bruteforce the otps

2) send the otp send link for the otp rate limit bypass technique (also check on reset otp)

3) analyse and change the response

4) send the 0000 -default otp to accept the req  -> check this for detail (https://cybersecuritywriteups.com/how-i-made-2000-from-an-easy-bug-431f45d8783e)

5)check for the rareparameters and headers which will makes for the rate limit protections.

2FA Bypass

1️⃣Log in with valid credentials to receive an OTP.
2️⃣ Capture the OTP request in a web proxy (Burp Suite, etc.).
3️⃣ Identify the POST request where the OTP is submitted.
4️⃣ Locate the RAREPARA parameter.
5️⃣ Send multiple incorrect OTPs & observe the rate limit.
6️⃣ Modify RAREPARA to an empty value & resend.
7️⃣ Notice that the rate limit is bypassed.
8️⃣ Use Burp Intruder to automate brute-force attempts.
9️⃣ Gain unauthorized access once the correct OTP is found.
